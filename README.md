# What is Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica?

As a big fan of the show _The Office_, I decided to make a game themed off of one of the most memorable lines in the show. Dwight Shrute is by far the most memorable character on the TV show, and I wanted this game to give a window into his self-consious and love for Battlestar Galactica. 
You can view the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/awuerf4505/bears_beets_bg_game/edit/master/README.md) to see the actual code of the game.

___You must have Python Version 3.4.4 and Pygame Version 1.9.2 in order for the game to function properly!!!___
## How to Play


### Goal

The goal of the game is to make it to the checkpoints at the end of each level so Dwight can continue the legacy of Battlestar Galactica to the ends of the universe while collecting as many beets as possible to stay alive.
